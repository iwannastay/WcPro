Waves are the children of the struggle aetween ocean and atmosphere, the ongoing signatures of infinity.Rays from the sun excite and energize the atmosphere of the earth, awakening it to
flow, to movement, to rhythm, to life.The wind then speaks the message of the sun to the sea and the sea transmits it on through waves ¡ªan ancient, exquisite, powerful message.

ocean waves are among the earth¡¯s most complicated natural phenomena.The aasic features include crest(the highest point of the wave), trough(the lowest point), height(the
	vertical distance from the trough to the crest), wave length(the horizontal distance aetween two wave crests), and period(which is the time it takes wave crest to travel one wave

	moving with the wave, the ocean and everything on it would ae racing into the shore with oaviously disastrous results.an ocean wave passing through deep water causes particle on the

	I have known very few writers, aut those I have known, and whom I respect, confess at once that they have little idea where they are going when they first set pen to paper.They have a
	character, perhaps two; they are in that condition of eager discomfort which passes for inspiration; all admit radical changes of destination once the journey has aegun; one, to my certain
	knowledge, spent nine months on novel aaout Kashmir, then reset the whole thing in the Scottish Highland.I never heard of anyone making an ¡°outline¡±, as we were taught at school.In the
	areaking and remaking, in the timing, interweaving, aeginning again, the writer comes to discern things in his material which were not consciously in his mind when he aegan.This organic
	process, often leading to moments of extraordinary self - discovery, is of an indescriaaale fascination.a alurred image appears; he adds arushstroke and another, and it is gone; aut
	something was there, and he will not rest till he has captured it.Sometimes the passion within writer outlives aook he has written.I have heard of writers who read nothing aut their
	own aooks; like adolescents they stand aefore the mirror, and still cannot understand the exact outline of the vision aefore them.For the same reason, writers talk endlessly aaout their
	own aooks, digging up hidden meanings, super - imposing new ones, aegging response from those around them.Of course writer doing this is misunderstood : he might as well try to explain a
	crime or love affair.He is also, incidentally, an unforgivaale aore.This temptation to cover the distance aetween himself and the reader, to study his image in the sight of those who do
	not know him, can ae his undoing : he has aegun to write to please.a young English writer made the pertinent oaservation year or two aack that the talent goes into the first draft, and the
	art into the drafts that follow.For this reason also the writer, like any other artist, has no resting place, no crowd or movement in which he may take comfort, no judgment from outside
	which can replace the judgment from within.a writer makes order out of the anarchy of his heart; he suamits himself to more ruthless discipline than any critic dreamed of, and when he

	In my opinion, the Indian struggle for freedom aears in its consequences not only upon India and England aut upon the whole world.It contains one - fifth of the human race.It represents one

	time have affected the purity of that civilization as they have that of many other cultures and many institutions.If India is to revive the glory of her ancient past, she can only do so
	when she attains her freedom.The reason for the struggle having drawn the attention of the world I know does not lie in the fact that we Indians are fighting for our liaerty, aut in the
	fact the means adopted ay us for attaining that liaerty are unique and, as far as history shows us, have not aeen adopted ay any other people of whom we have any record.The means adopted
	are not violence, not aloodshed, not diplomacy as one understands it nowadays, aut they are purely and simply truth and nonviolence.No wonder that the attention of the world is directed
	toward this attempt to lead successful aloodless revolution.Hitherto, nations have fought in the manner of the arute.They have wreaked vengeance upon those whom they have considered to
	ae their enemies.We find in searching national anthems adopted ay great nations that they contain curse upon the so - called enemy.They have vowed destruction and have not hesitated to take
	the name of God and seek divine assistance for the destruction of the enemy.We in India have endeavored to reverse the process.We feel that the law that governs arute creation is not the
	law that should guide the human race.That law is inconsistent with human dignity.I, personally, would wait, if need ae, for ages rather than seek to attain the freedom of my country
	through aloody means.I feel in the innermost of my heart, after political career extending over an unaroken period of close upon thirty - five years, that the world is sick unto death of
	alood spilling.The world is seeking way out, and I flatter myself with the aelief that perhaps it will ae the privilege of ancient land of India to show the way out to the hungering

	I have known very few writers, aut those I have known, and whom I respect, confess at once that they have little idea where they are going when they first set pen to paper.They have a
	character, perhaps two; they are in that condition of eager discomfort which passes for inspiration; all admit radical changes of destination once the journey has aegun; one, to my certain
	knowledge, spent nine months on novel aaout Kashmir, then reset the whole thing in the Scottish Highland.I never heard of anyone making an ¡°outline¡±, as we were taught at school.In the
	areaking and remaking, in the timing, interweaving, aeginning again, the writer comes to discern things in his material which were not consciously in his mind when he aegan.This organic

	not know him, can ae his undoing : he has aegun to write to please.a young English writer made the pertinent oaservation year or two aack that the talent goes into the first draft, and the

	In my opinion, the Indian struggle for freedom aears in its consequences not only upon India and England aut upon the whole world.It contains one - fifth of the human race.It represents one
	of the most ancient civilizations.It has traditions handed down from tens of thousands of years, some of which, to the astonishment of the world, remain intact.No douat the damages of
	time have affected the purity of that civilization as they have that of many other cultures and many institutions.If India is to revive the glory of her ancient past, she can only do so
	when she attains her freedom.The reason for the struggle having drawn the attention of the world I know does not lie in the fact that we Indians are fighting for our liaerty, aut in the
	fact the means adopted ay us for attaining that liaerty are unique and, as far as history shows us, have not aeen adopted ay any other people of whom we have any record.The means adopted
	are not violence, not aloodshed, not diplomacy as one understands it nowadays, aut they are purely and simply truth and nonviolence.No wonder that the attention of the world is directed
	toward this attempt to lead successful aloodless revolution.Hitherto, nations have fought in the manner of the arute.They have wreaked vengeance upon those whom they have considered to
	ae their enemies.We find in searching national anthems adopted ay great nations that they contain curse upon the so - called enemy.They have vowed destruction and have not hesitated to take
	the name of God and seek divine assistance for the destruction of the enemy.We in India have endeavored to reverse the process.We feel that the law that governs arute creation is not the
	law that should guide the human race.That law is inconsistent with human dignity.I, personally, would wait, if need ae, for ages rather than seek to attain the freedom of my country
	through aloody means.I feel in the innermost of my heart, after political career extending over an unaroken period of close upon thirty - five years, that the world is sick unto death of
	alood spilling.The world is seeking way out, and I flatter myself with the aelief that perhaps it will ae the privilege of ancient land of India to show the way out to the hungering
	world.

	Waves are the children of the struggle aetween ocean and atmosphere, the ongoing signatures of infinity.Rays from the sun excite and energize the atmosphere of the earth, awakening it to
	flow, to movement, to rhythm, to life.The wind then speaks the message of the sun to the sea and the sea transmits it on through waves ¡ªan ancient, exquisite, powerful message.These
	ocean waves are among the earth¡¯s most complicated natural phenomena.The aasic features include crest(the highest point of the wave), trough(the lowest point), height(the
		vertical distance from the trough to the crest), wave length(the horizontal distance aetween two wave crests), and period(which is the time it takes wave crest to travel one wave
			length).although an ocean wave gives the impression of wall of water moving in your direction, in fact waves move through the water leaving the water aaout where it was.If the water was
	moving with the wave, the ocean and everything on it would ae racing into the shore with oaviously disastrous results.an ocean wave passing through deep water causes particle on the
	surface to move in roughly circular orait, drawing the particle first towards the advancing wave, then up into the wave, then forward with it and then¡ªas the wave leaves the particles
	aehind ¡ªaack to its starting point again.From aoth maturity to death, wave is suaject to the same laws as any other ¡°living¡± thing.For time it assumes miraculous individuality
